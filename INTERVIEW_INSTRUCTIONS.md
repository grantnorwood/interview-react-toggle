# Instructions for Interview Code Exercises

## Run the exercise

1. Fork and clone this repo into your own GitHub account.  _(If you don't have a GitHub account, you may still clone the repo and publish to another online Git store, or send a .diff for the fix.)_
1. Setup and run the application as per the [Development](https://github.com/grantnorwood/interview-react-toggle#development) section of the README.
1. Once running at http://localhost:8080/, look for any obvious bugs or errors on the index page.
1. Run the Mocha tests with `npm test` and look for any failing unit tests.
1. Fix any broken unit tests, then commit to a new branch and push it to your public Git store for review.
1. Create and submit a pull request for your fixes.

_When you're finished, you may be asked some additional questions below :)_

## Other questions

1. What if other developers have been working in the `master` branch while you're developing your feature or fixes?  How would you integrate their changes **before** you merge your branch back to `master`?
1. What if multiple developers are working on your one feature branch?  How would you integrate everyone's changes so that all work on a single feature (or set of features) is merged back to `master` at the same time?
